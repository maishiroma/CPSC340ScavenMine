# Overview
- This game was based on the theme of 30 seconds. So, I have created a mini game where every 30 seconds, the scenery would change and the enemies will get faster.

# Goal
- Scout the land for gems, using the player's radar. If the player gets hit three times, the game ends.

# Controls
- WASD Keys: move
- Space: Dig
  - The player will have an "!" mark when they are close to a gem. This mark will grow bigger and bigger the closer the player is to a gem.
